= SAPUI5 Proxy setup


== Why?

If your SAPUI5 app needs to communicate with a server you can't just open the html file directly in a browser as the ajax calls will fail due the (Same Origin Policy)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy] enforced by browsers. 

During development we can use a proxy server to get around this problem.


SAPUI5 is Javascript development so I'd like to use Javascript tools which ultimatly means nodejs & npm.

`json-proxy` is a simple proxy server that is easy to setup & configure.

or/and
